# 001.005 First Program: "Hello, World!"

## Introduction
The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional first program for beginners learning a new programming language. In this lesson, we'll create this simple program in C# to demonstrate basic syntax and structure.

## Code Example

```csharp
using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // This is a simple "Hello, World!" program in C#
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. `using System;` - This is a namespace declaration that gives us access to basic system functions, including the `Console` class we use to display output.

2. `class HelloWorld` - Defines a class named "HelloWorld". In C#, all code must be contained within classes.

3. `static void Main()` - This is the main method, the entry point of the program. Every C# console application must have one Main method.

4. `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` - This line outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console and adds a new line after it.

## Running the Program
To run this program:
1. Save it in a file named `HelloWorld.cs`
2. Compile it with the C# compiler: `csc HelloWorld.cs`
3. Run the executable: `HelloWorld.exe`

## Output
When you run the program, you'll see:
```
Hello, World!
```
