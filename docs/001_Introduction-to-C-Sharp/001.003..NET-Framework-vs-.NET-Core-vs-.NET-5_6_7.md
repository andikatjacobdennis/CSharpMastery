### .NET Framework
- **Windows-only** legacy platform
- Stable, mature, but no major new features
- Best for existing enterprise apps tied to Windows (e.g., WPF, WinForms)

### .NET Core
- Cross-platform, open-source
- High performance, modular
- Introduced modern features like CLI tools and side-by-side installs
- Replaced by .NET 5+

### .NET 5/6/7+ (Modern .NET)
- Unified platform (replaces both Framework and Core)
- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS
- LTS releases: .NET 6 (2021), .NET 8 (2023), etc.
- Improved performance, cloud-native, modern language support
